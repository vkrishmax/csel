Why Automation

In this Agile world, it is a challenge for software companies to continuously maintain and 
improve the quality and efficiency of software systems development. 

In many software projects, testing is neglected because of time or cost constraints. 
This leads to a lack of product quality, followed by customer dissatisfaction and ultimately to 
increased overall quality costs.

The main reasons for Automation:

Accuracy in Test Execution
Less cost compare to Manual Testing
Less time consumption
Easy to maintanince of regression

Test automation can improve the development process of a software product in many cases. 
The  automation of tests is initially associated with increased effort, 
but the related benefits will quickly pay off.

Why Selenium

Selenium is an Open source with more robust automation framework, 
Selenium is suite used to automate web browsers by using testing frameworks with 
various program language like Java, Python, Perl, C#, PHP, Ruby. 
It is also supported in many browsers and platforms. 
The main purpose of Selenium is to automate testing of web applications and can also be used for
automating repeated web-based administration tasks or Regression suite.

What Selenium 


Selenium is a package of various test components which consists of the following three major tools. 
Each one has a specific role in aiding the development of test automation for a Web application.

1. Selenium IDE – A Firefox extension to record test cases and suites.
2. Selenium RC – Used to run tests on different browsers and systems.
3. Selenium Grid – Runs multiple instances of Selenium RC at once.
4. Qualitia and Tellurium – A wrapper for the Selenium engine.
