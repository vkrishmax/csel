Why Automation

In this Agile world, it is a challenge for software companies to continuously maintain and 
improve the quality and efficiency of software systems development. 

In many software projects, testing is neglected because of time or cost constraints. 
This leads to a lack of product quality, followed by customer dissatisfaction and ultimately to 
increased overall quality costs.

The main reasons for Automation:

Accuracy in Test Execution
Less cost compare to Manual Testing
Less time consumption
Easy to maintanince of regression

Test automation can improve the development process of a software product in many cases. 
The  automation of tests is initially associated with increased effort, 
but the related benefits will quickly pay off.
